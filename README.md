# shortest path algorithms & Neural Network from scratch & PyTorch implmentation of the Neural Network  

You need to develop a simple game consisting of a
rectangular grid (of size height x width ) where each cell has a random integer value between
0 and 9. An agent starts at the upper-left corner of the grid and must reach the lower-right
corner of the grid as fast as possible.
